## Task 1

remove-identical.go

Write a pipeline [...] (a goroutine) that remembers the previous value and only
sends the value to the next stage of the pipeline if itâ€™s different from the one
that came before. [...] assume that the first value is never the empty string.

## Task 2

split-words.go

Write a pipeline element that takes strings, splits them up into words (you can
use the `Fields` function from the `strings` package), and sends all the words,
one by one, to the next pipeline stage.
